Hi, feb! Sorry if I’m being a little selfish right now, but to be honest, I really miss you. I’m happy with everything that’s going on with you right now. Even if I know I shouldn’t show it too much, sometimes I just can’t help myself. I hate the fact that I’m doing this, but I don’t want to hide it either because the truth is you’re always on my mind.

I’m not expecting anything, but I guess part of me still keeps holding on… still hoping that maybe we feel the same way too. But whatever happens, I’m already happy knowing you’re there, and that I get to have these little moments with you.
